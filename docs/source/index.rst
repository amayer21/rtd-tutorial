Welcome to the GIGA mass storage & cluster documentation
==========================================================

The GIGA provides its members with a professional infrastructure to store their precious 
research data (hereafter called mass storage) as well as with a high-performance computing 
system (hereafter called cluster) to perform computer intensive analysis.
